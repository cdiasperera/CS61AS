As I am not on a berkley computer (and not a berkley student) I could not 
install the base components required for this subject. Instead, a bit of 
googling lead me to a completed project. I removed any code that was required of
me to write, and kept anything else there. I've written down in a comment
any code that I completed.

I believe I completed the project in the spirit of it :)

If you would like a copy of the project files, sans procedures you have to add
yourself, simply delete any procedures with the comment 'defined by me'.

To change the viewport size, change the units in the definition of 'vp'.

Note 1: The view-port does not open automatically. You have to run a painter
command in the REPL to see the drawing.

Note 2: This project MAY depend on Dr. Racket.
